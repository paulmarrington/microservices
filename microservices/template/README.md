# Template Microservice

Use this directory as a template for your microservice.
Just copy the directory and rename it to your service name.
Then edit each file in turn. Replace this blurb with that
more relevent to your microservice.

    Dockerfile:   probably won't need to change
    package.json: update name, description, author and files
    service.js:   add your service actions
    spec.js:      jasmine specifications file
